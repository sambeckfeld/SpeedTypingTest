# SpeedTypingTest
A speed typing test for my final project

This is a speed typing test to check for accuracy and the time it took to finish typing

I have decided to use tkinter to build the bulk of my project

I created 3 buttons that all serve different functions. One to reset the word, one to submit the word, and one to reset the game

So far what I have done is...

The interface of the project including an image background using PIL from Pillow,
A function to get a new random word,
and a function that checks the word the user typed in,

What I don't have done is...

A function to check the spelling of the word typed in and seeing if it matches the word from my list,
A time function to give a clock,
And a function to reset the game,

I've started on the check_word function to check the spelling of the words but had trouble with running a few different things into the parameters.
